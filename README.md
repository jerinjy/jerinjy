## AT89C51 programmer using arduino
##### As an enthusiast in embedded systems, I designed a custom AT89C51 parallel programmer using an Arduino Nano. Initially, the AT89C51 required 27 pins for programming (including address lines, control lines, and VPP). This pin count was further reduced down to 13pins by indigenously using two 8-bit shift register. This was achieved by concatenating the 12-bit address lines and 4-bit control lines to form a 16-bit signal. This 16-bit signal was reduced down to a 3-bit signal by using the Serial-In-Parallel-Out (SIPO) configuration of the shift register. The AT89C51 needs a 12V programming voltage (VPP) signal during flashing. To achieve this, an IRF540N MOSFET was incorporated to level shift the logic of the VPP signal. This component efficiently controlled the VPP logic, ensuring successful programming. Rather than relying on higher-level abstractions (such as the HAL layer), i opted for register-level coding of the arduino. By directly manipulating registers, i matched the timing diagram requirements of the AT89C51, achieving faster data transfer.
## (7, 4) Hamming Code algorithm
##### Hardware implementation of the Hamming Code. The project aims at locating and correcting errors in a 4-bit data stream using (7, 4) Hamming Code algorithm. The hardware was setup in bread board and wired using single core wires
## IoT based Smart Energy Meter
##### A cloud connected energy meter to monitor and generate usage statistics. The payment bill and payment link is sent directly to the users mobile through razorpay by sms. An alternative solution to the current implementation of meterman in KSEB Or other electricity boards. The meter has automatic cutoff and usage prediction feature.
## 7-level Cascaded H-bridge Inverter
##### The project aims at simulating the CHB inverter using Matlab software.
